## Using VBA
The Visual Basic Application or more commonly known as VBA helps in the analysis of large data sets that Excel formulas might not handle.
The most basic VBA progam one can write returns a Message Box that says "Hello World!"
```vba
Sub MacroCheck()
  Dim testMessage As String
  testMessage = "Hello World!"
  MsgBox (testMessage)
End Sub
```
